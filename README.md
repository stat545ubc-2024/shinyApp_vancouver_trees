## Description
The **Vancouver Trees Shiny App** is an interactive web application designed to explore data about trees in Vancouver. The app provides tools for filtering, sorting, and analyzing tree-related data. It is divided into two main views:

### 1. Main Explorer:
- **Interactive Filtering:** 
  - Select one or more neighborhoods to filter the tree data.
  - Use the dropdown menu to choose neighborhoods.
- **Sorting:** 
  - Use the checkbox to sort the table by `common_name` alphabetically.
- **Search:** 
  - Quickly locate specific rows using the built-in search functionality.
- **Download Filtered Data:**
  - Export the filtered data as a CSV file for offline analysis.
- **Dynamic Summary:**
  - Displays the number of trees matching the current filter.

### 2. Neighborhood Analysis (New in Updated Version):
- **Tree Species Selection:**
  - Select a specific tree species (common name) for analysis.
- **Neighborhood Bar Plot:**
  - View a bar plot of tree counts grouped by neighborhood for the selected species.
- **Street-Level Analysis:**
  - Enable detailed street-level analysis using the checkbox.
  - Select a specific neighborhood to see street-level distributions of the selected tree species.
- **Street Bar Plot and Table:**
  - Explore street-level counts of the selected species in a chosen neighborhood.
